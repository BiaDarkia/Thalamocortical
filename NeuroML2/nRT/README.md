**Spike times versus time step: the NeuroML2 model simulated in NEURON.
Dashed black lines - spike times at the 0.0001 ms time step; Green - spike times at the following time steps (in ms): [0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025].**

**Spike times versus spatial discretization: the NeuroML2 model simulated in NEURON.
Default value for the number of internal divs is 1078.
Dashed black lines - spike times at the 20923 internal divisions; Blue - spike times at the following values of internal divisions:
[228, 446, 1078, 1078, 2124, 4222, 10490, 20923].**
