The files in this foler are designed to be used in conjuction with other files:

1) the NEURON implementation of the 2005 Traub model available at
http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDb/showmodel.asp?model=82894

2) the above installation needs to be unpacked in a folder ../nrntraub/ parallel to this folder

3) the following symlinks are assumed:
./batchdata@ -> /tmp/batchdata  // this is a folder output for simulations
./dat@ -> ../nrntraub/dat       // this folder is useful to store data from reference measured data
./umac@ -> ../nrntraub/umac     // this folder is created when you compile the MOD files in the ../nrntraub/ folder


//// documentation for individual files:

nrngui traub2005figA3.hoc   // run this to recreate the published figures for L4SS in figure A3




A lot of testing neuron code is part of myonecell.hoc and myplot.hoc, more documentation, cleanup needed.




plotDat.py  // plotting utility that works with wildcards (plotDat.py  file*.dat)


spiny.sh    // utility file to compare models during editing to ensure they have not changed
reformat.pl // utility to reformat settings to tabular output
